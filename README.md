    <h4> As I mentioned at our First Day of School Assembly, I am looking for HSFI Student Leaders to join our newly created Success Skills Team.  These groups will bring students and staff together towards the following 3 goals:

    (1) Focus HSFI on a commitment to issues of Equity & Belongingness working alongside with our Success Skills
    
    (2) Develop HSFI's commitment to an Equal Partnership between Students & Staff
    
    (3) Continue to Improve the School - we are always trying to get better
    </h4>
   </ol>
    
     
    <ol>
    <h4>Here is what a Student Member of a Success Skill Team will do and how will you benefit from joining these teams:
    
    (1) Join a team of students and staff members that will focus on a specific Success Skill - this team will work together to identify what we can as a community to help develop these skills
    
    (2) Success Skill Teams will meet on the last Monday every month from 8:50 am to 9:40 am so you will need to come into school on that one Monday a month a little earlier
    
    (3) All you need to bring is your ideas and an open mind
    
    (4) Joining a Success Skills Team will be an excellent addition to your resume and college applications - you will have something to put down to demonstrate your leadership skills
    
    (5) FOOD - We will have a breakfast available to Success Skills Student Team members before the meeting
    
    (6) We will pay you a stipend of Fashion Dollars every month to spend at the FLY School Store
    
    (7) STRONG STUDENT VOICE - You will have a voice in improving HSFI - we live here together everyday and want to make things better for everyone</h4>
