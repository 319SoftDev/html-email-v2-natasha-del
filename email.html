    <h1>HSFI Students

If you decide between now and Monday morning that you want to join our Success Skills teams, you still can.

All students who are on these teams have been directly contacted by me and sent a calendar invite on their NYC Department of Education accounts.

Please just send me a message on Jupiter or email me at dblank@schools.nyc.gov

You will need to be here at 8:30 am on Monday where we will have breakfast snacks waiting for you.

Thank you.

Mr. Blank
